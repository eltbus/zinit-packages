üåª Welcome to [zinit](https://github.com/zdharma-continuum/zinit)'s package

# Developers!

## Creating new packages

To create a new package named `foo`:

```zsh
./gen-pkg-json.sh create foo
```

This will create a directory named `foo` which contains:

- `default.ices.zsh`: Your source file where you can define your zinit
ices and will later be used for genereting `package.json`
- `package.json`: this is what `zinit pack` actually consumes

To add another profile (as in `zinit pack"PROFILE" for PACKAGE`), for example
`bar`:

```zsh
./gen-pkg-json.sh create foo bar
```

This will create a new file in your package directory: `bar.ices.zsh`.

## The package format

As mentionned above you should start by editing your `.ices.zsh` file.

üìì Exactly one zinit call is required in there, multiple `zinit` calls are not
supported.

üìù You can also define metadata in your `.ices.zsh` files:

| Variable     | Description                           | Example Value                               |

## Updating `package.json` files

To generate a `package.json` file for your package run:

```zsh
# Replace these
pkg=null
profile=default

./gen-pkg-json.sh ${pkg} ${profile}
```
